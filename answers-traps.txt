a0-a8
a2 holds 13 in main's call to printf.
No call to function f in the assembly code of main.
No call to function g in the assembly code of main, either. Compiler inline the two functions.
0000000000000630 <printf>:
0x0000000000000038
Output: He110 World
If the RISC-V were instead big-endian, in order to yield the same output, i need be set to 0x726c6400
no need to change 57616
Maybe output: x=3 y=0. The register a2 may holds zero, so 'y=0'
